// Task 1: Customer Invoice Calculation

function calculateInvoice(subtotal, taxRate, discount) {
    let total = (subtotal + (subtotal * taxRate)) - discount;
    return `Total Invoice: $${total.toFixed(2)}`;
};
console.log(calculateInvoice(100, 0.08, 5)); // Expected: "Total Invoice: $103.00"
console.log(calculateInvoice(500, 0.1, 20)); // Expected: "Total Invoice: $530.00"

// Created a function that takes three parameters and implemented a formula to compute an invoice, then returned sample test data.
